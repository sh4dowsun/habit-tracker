# Habit Tracker app

[![CI](https://github.com/sh4dowsun/habit-tracker/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sh4dowsun/habit-tracker/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

A single page app that lets you add habits, tick today, shows the last seven days and a live streak count. Data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage.

## Running locally
Running the app locally requires running a local HTTP server.

### With VSCode:
* Install a `Live Preview` extension
* Open `index.html` and run a live server by clicking the preview button in the top right corner or using the context menu

### Using Node:
* `npx http-server . -p 8080`
* Open `http://localhost:8080`
